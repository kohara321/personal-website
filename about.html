        <p class="aboutSection" style="margin-bottom: -60px; color: #9e9e9b">I am the youngest of three siblings. I obtained a Bachelor's of Biology from the University of Texas at El Paso but found inspiration to change paths to programming following my sister. </p>
        <p class="aboutSection" style="color: #9e9e9b">During my free time I enjoy playing piano, folding origami, practicing drawing, or spending time playing video games with friends. I also enjoy many outdoor activities (skiing, camping, hiking, etc.) and have participated in a few sports (baseball, wrestling, swimming, bowling, etc.) in my child and teenage years.</p>
        <p class="aboutSection" style="color: #9e9e9b">Some of my favorite foods include a lot of the usual like pizza, burgers, sweet stuff, but I also enjoy Chicken Ã  la King, beef stroganoff, and jambalaya (without shrimp, I am not a seafood person). I don't have a particular favorite genre of music, I like to listen to a little of everything, and I like most types of movies too.</p>
